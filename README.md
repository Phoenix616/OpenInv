# OpenInv
Bukkit plugin to change inventories and enderchests of online and offline players. Documentation can be found on the original [Bukkit dev page](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/openinv/).

The [original version](https://github.com/lishid/OpenInv) dropped support for older CraftBukkit/Spigot versions. This fork aims to maintain the original backwards compatibility while at the same time keeping up to date with future Minecraft versions!
